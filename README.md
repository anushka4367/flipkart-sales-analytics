## 🧠 Business Problem
Flipkart hosts a wide range of products across multiple categories and price segments.  
Business stakeholders require a consolidated analytical view to understand:
- How products are distributed across price bands
- Discount patterns across pricing segments
- Customer perception through ratings
- Revenue contribution by payment modes
- Product segments with higher return risk

This project aims to support data-driven decision-making by transforming raw sales data into meaningful insights.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering (Python)
The raw dataset was cleaned and transformed using Python:
- Converted date columns to proper datetime format
- Handled missing values in categorical fields
- Ensured numerical consistency for price and rating columns
- Created new analytical features:
  - `discount_amount`
  - `price_band`
  - `rating_band`
  - `return_risk_flag`
  - `listing_year`, `listing_month`

The cleaned dataset was then prepared for SQL analysis and visualization.

## 🗄 Data Analysis (MySQL)
The cleaned data was loaded into a MySQL database and analyzed using SQL queries to:
- Analyze product distribution across price bands
- Study average selling price and discount behavior
- Identify monthly listing trends
- Analyze revenue contribution by payment modes
- Detect high return-risk product segments

---

## 📊 Data Visualization (Power BI)
An interactive Power BI dashboard was built to visualize insights:
- KPI cards for overall metrics
- Monthly trend analysis
- Pricing and discount analysis
- Product rating distribution
- Payment mode revenue treemap
- Interactive slicers for dynamic filtering

The dashboard enables stakeholders to explore data intuitively and make informed decisions.

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Medium price band contains the highest number of product listings
- Lower-priced products receive higher discounts
- Majority of products have Average to Good ratings
- Revenue is evenly distributed across major payment modes
- Return risk is concentrated in specific product segments
